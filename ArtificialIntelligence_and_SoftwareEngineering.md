## Artificial Intelligence in Software Engineering
The rise of large language models capable of producing code is set to transform software engineering in many and profound ways. These models can already generate working prototypes, automate boilerplate (common place) code production, and assist with debugging, effectively accelerating development cycles. In the near future, they will likely become an integral part of the development process, serving as intelligent collaborators that can understand high-level requirements and translate them into functional code. This could enable developers to focus more on architecture, problem-solving and creative decision-making, rather than spending time on repetitive implementation tasks. This is rather like the transition from low-level to high-level languages in the 1960s, or the addition on visual programming to IDEs in the early 2000s.

This shift does not mean that human software engineers will become obsolete. While large language models can write code, they do not inherently understand the context, user needs, or the nuances of complex systems in the same way humans do. Engineers will remain essential for defining problems, making strategic technical choices, ensuring security and compliance and integrating code into larger systems. In practice, these models will act as productivity multipliers, augmenting human capability rather than replacing it outright.

Over time, the role of the software engineer may evolve from primarily writing code to curating, refining, and validating AI-generated solutions. Skills such as prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and AI-assisted testing will become increasingly valuable. As tools mature, the barrier to entry for creating software may drop significantly, allowing more people from non-technical backgrounds to build applications. This democratization of coding will likely lead to a surge in innovation, but it will also require new standards, oversight, and education to ensure quality, security, and maintainability in AI-generated systems. The software engineer is likely to be the key in this situation.

### Going Forward
Over the next decade to decade and a half, large language models are likely to reshape software engineering into a far more collaborative process between humans and AI. In the early part of this period, we can expect these systems to become embedded directly into development environments, continuously offering code completions, automated documentation, and context-aware bug fixes. Developers will spend less time searching through documentation or re-implementing standard patterns and more time focusing on system design, integration, and creative problem solving.

By the middle of this window, code generation will likely become multi-modal, with models interpreting diagrams, spoken requirements, and even sketches to produce working applications. The role of the engineer will shift further toward being a technical architect and quality gatekeeper, ensuring that AI-produced systems meet performance, security, and regulatory requirements. Model-assisted testing will become the norm, with AI generating comprehensive test suites and monitoring live systems for anomalies, reducing the frequency of large-scale production failures.

In the longer view, perhaps around the fifteen-year mark, AI systems could be capable of autonomously building and maintaining entire software platforms, integrating themselves with other AI systems to adapt to changing requirements. At that stage, human involvement might primarily be in defining high-level objectives, managing ethics and governance, and innovating in problem spaces that require human insight, empathy, or cultural understanding. The profession may become more interdisciplinary, with software engineers collaborating closely with domain experts in healthcare, climate science, education, and other fields to design solutions that blend deep technical sophistication with real-world expertise.

While this trajectory points toward dramatic efficiency gains, it also raises challenges in trust, accountability, and skill retention. The ability to critically evaluate, debug, and extend complex systems will remain vital, especially in safety-critical applications. The most successful engineers will likely be those who embrace AI as a partner while cultivating skills in leadership, systems thinking, and cross-domain collaboration.

### What does this mean for us?
In the medium term there will be a need for a skilled Software Engineers to produce and manage large scale projects. They will need to understand various computer languages and the needs of large scale projects, such as security, quality, testing, maintainability etc. The software engineer will likely use AI models to produce elements of code that they will then integrate into the main system. They will manage the development and maintenance of large software systems for years to come.
